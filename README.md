# Wine Quality Dataset
> Wine Quality Dataset research student project using PCA, RandomForestClassifier, Decision Trees , k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes.

## General Information
This is a student research project of Wine Quality Dataset. The main goal was to consolidate knowledge in practice how to apply PCA use RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, GaussianNB and to compare results.
Average classification accuracy of dataset with using any of the above classificators and applying PCA is 55-60%.
The attribute by which the data is classified is wine quality, so I decided to reduce the number of wine quality levels to increase accuracy(~98%).

## Libraries Used
- sklearn
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn

## Setup
The project hosts a jupyter notebook, so it can be downloaded and simply run. There is also a requirements.txt file in the root with all the necessary libraries to run.

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_
